# Trusted Environment
## Trusted Environment Ontology for sharing Identity Verifying Events

  <p>

  The Trusted Environment project is working on an hypothesis that organisations with an existing relationship with someone can help those people prove who they are and what they are entitled to do by providing other organisations with proof of due diligence events that they have undertaken.
  </p>
<p>
The project is run under the direction of the <a target"_blank" href="https://www.openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a> and is sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">UK Gov GDS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs">HMRC</a>.

## Ontology 

This Ontology, model, is being worked on at https://ontologies.interition.info/webprotege/ , exported and checked into this repository.

## Tests

This repository is for developing the queries for testing the hypothesis and laying the foundations for a framework on which implementations can evolve.

### Examples

Tests for UK GOV <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">GPG 45</a> .

* Was a check supervised by a qualified individual?
* Was the check done with an accepted method?
* Did the check use an official template?
* Was the person doing the check trained in X?
* Was evidence validated using an authoritative source?
