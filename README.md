# Trusted Environment
## Trusted Environment Ontology for sharing Identity Verifying Events

  <p>

  The Trusted Environment project is working on an hypothesis that organisations with an existing relationship with someone can help those people prove who they are and what they are entitled to do by providing other organisations with proof of due diligence events that they have undertaken.
